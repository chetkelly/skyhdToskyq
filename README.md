# skyhdToskyq

I believe Sky originally supported using the Sky HD remote with the Sky Q box but disabled it in a firmware update. Using any of the Ken Shirriff based arduino IR libraries we can easily create a circuit to map the Sky HD remote to the Sky Q commands.

The code is commented quite well but if there is any questions please ask.
